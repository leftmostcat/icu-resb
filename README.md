# icu-resb

This is an experimental crate for reading and writing both the text and binary
formats for ICU resource bundles. At present, all development is taking place in
branches to indicate that API and functionality are not settled enough even for
alpha usage.

## Branch Contents

This branch contains:
- a `nom`-based parser for text resource bundles.
- a `nom`-based parser for binary resource bundles.
- a generator for binary resource bundles.
